User:
- Available locales (en nl ...)
- Option to show/hide Formhistory Control in FF app menu (introduced in FF4), default is show
- Backup multiline fields while typing (editor fields) -> manage from main UI
- Added button to show/hide cleanup options (cleanup tab)- Fix: skip duplicate entries from imported xml-file
- Changed: improved regular expression for Creditcards
- Added Export/Import manager (choose what to export/import)
- Added option to export/import dates in ISO format (default)


Technical:
- MaxVersion FF to ...
- Getting rid of all threads (processNextEvent)
- Places lookup query is processed in the background (using a timer-thread ) if it takes more than 250ms
- Places lookup optimization, only query for dates present in the history table (> earliestVisit date)
- Minor bugfix: formhistorycontrols toolbarmenu or statusbarmenu can be null (fixes: "Error: tbMenu is null")
- Converted BrowseHistory from HTML-XUL mix (iframe+places.html) into pure XUL

ToDo:
- Prevent formhistory for specific fields (not related to a domain)
- When importing from xml, import preferences only after okay (and maybe add a checkbox in the import/export dialog)
