- AboutFhc.js
  Inadvertently reversed the em:creator and em:homepageURL tags,
  so the aboutbox shows the url where it should have displayed my name,
  and the homepage links to my name which obviously will not work.

- locales
  not translated completely yet: hu-HU, zh-CN
  added amo.screenshot.* to amo.properties

- install.rdf
  update seamonkey max. version to 2.1a1pre

- xxx.js
  bla bla

COMMENTS STILL TO DO:
- FhcDbHandler.js
- FhcUtil.js
- FhcXmlHandler.js
- HistoryTreeView.js
- HistoryWindowControl.js

NOT DOING THESE (self explanatory):
- FhcPreferenceHandler
