User:
- Re-enabled Saving formhistory of additional formfields after fixing performance issue.

Technical:
- Made bulk-insert of formelements transactional to drastically speedup multiple inserts.


ToDo:
- Preferences overlay does not work in FF >= 36.0 (is no longer a dialog, is opened inside tab)\
- Many changes needed to support Multiprocess Firefox (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox)
- Prevent formhistory for specific fields (not related to a domain)
