ToDo ongoing:
- Test on MacOSx, Linux, Seamonkey, Flock
- Add release-notes to blog
- Change help-section blog

ToDo:
- Perform cleanup each time a form is submitted (FhcFormSaveOverlay)
  + cleanup on submit for whitelisted/blacklisted domains only
- Make a backup first of deleted history items (in a user-defined location)
- Show current active formfield-name
- Export encrypted
- Access password protected
- Separate toolbar/taskbar-icon for cleanup (1-click-cleanup)
- Sorting A-Za-z or AaBb-Zz configurable?
- Show current focused formfield(list) (if any) in statusbar or title
- Incorporate version in database?
- Message when cleanup-after x days is longer than Mozilla's
- dtd file per xul window/dialog
- Make a FAQ on the blog
- Warning when FF settings prevent formhistory to be stored

Ideas:
- Save textarea-fields like input-fields while typing (like Lazarus)
  + Add formhistory to multiline textArea (on submit as well as during editing)
- (Rename Preference-informationTab -> database)
- (Rename never-cleanup tab --> protect (en-US nl-NL))
- Save advanced searches

- FhcDbHandler.js
- FhcUtil.js
- FhcXmlHandler.js
- HistoryTreeView.js
- HistoryWindowControl.js

NOT DOING THESE (self explanatory):
