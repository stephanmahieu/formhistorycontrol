User:
- Update pt-BR locale
- Update nl locale
- Save history for radiobuttons/checkboxes/selects
- Formfill now also restores radiobuttons, checkboxes, selects and the html5 inputs: range, number and color
- Export to CSV: added option to export All entries, Selected entries or the entire Search result
- Bugfix: Change in the Global Privacy Options to let FHC manage the formhistory
   (checkbox) was not saved (option could only be changed from the add-ons preferences).
- Bugfix: Also store (multiline) text typed into divs with contenteditable attribute set to true
- Improvement: Adjust orientation (vertical) of menu (dropdown-arrow) of fhc-icon
  when inserted into the menu-panel (see  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Australis_add-on_compat)

Technical:
- Resolve Mozilla validation warnings:
  - nsITreeView interface change
  - unsafe use of innerHTML
  - deprecated nsIPrefBranch2, nsILocalFile and nsIPrivateBrowsingService
- Replace deprecated nsIFormHistory2 with custom implementation
- minVersion Firefox from 3.0.9 to 22.0
- minVersion SeaMonkey from 2.0a3 to 2.19 (gecko 22)


ToDo:
- Preferences overlay does not work in FF >= 36.0 (is no longer a dialog, is opened inside tab)\
- Many changes needed to support Multiprocess Firefox (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox)
- Prevent formhistory for specific fields (not related to a domain)
