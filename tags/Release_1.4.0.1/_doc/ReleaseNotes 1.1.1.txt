- locales
  added amo.properties (only used by babelzilla) to allow for translation of amo website and description in install.rdf
  added de-DE, pt-BR, ru-RU, es-ES

- AboutFHC.js
  get creator and homepageURL directly from install.rdf since they are treated as locale-dependant and I do not want to add these in every locale
- FhcRdfExtensionHandler.js
  added method getByTagname() to directly read textcontent from a specific locale independend tag in install.rdf
